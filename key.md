- use input range (max/min) of a problem outside main to calculate ahead
- dp for time
- sort/bitwise is fast
- bitvector/set is fast
- lambda op (especially for sorting)
- absolute difference (for distance)
- construction using pub/construct then compare
- long long for >10^9
- sometimes, we don't need a list
- two pointers
- binary search
- operation = DP x >> 1 == x / 2, but faster
- x & 1 == x % 2 == 1, but faster
- 1 << x == 2^x
- strict subtasks for bruteforce
