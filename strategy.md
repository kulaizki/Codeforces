- Read the problem for 2 minutes.
- Think of the solution for 3 minutes.
- Implement the solution and get all subtasks to which I find the solution within 3 minutes
- Think of the solution for 10 more minutes.
- If I cannot find better solutions, give up this problem and move on to the next one. If I could find a better solution, implement it. 
- If the implementation is heavy, it takes more than 50 minutes in total of this process. In this case, the duration I can put on the second part will be reduced.
- Check edgecases
